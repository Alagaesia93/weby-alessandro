Dummy project to create a Rails-like app without Rails
Credits to https://github.com/akshayKhot - course https://courses.writesoftwarewell.com/p/rails-companion

## First chapter

Puma
launch app with `rackup`
Live reloading

TODOs / Suggestions:

- Content-Type must be lowercase
- How to change from Puma to Thin

## Second chapter

Rack

TODOs / Suggestions:

- some single quotes, some double. Rubocop / Standard is the way (preference for Rubocop, it's going to be default on Rails 8)
- expand on the "Tools to Build + Middleware" section with some examples

## Third chapter - Routes

TODOs / Suggestions:

- at the end of the first chapter config.ru had some available changes with map /welcome. If you change to that, the first steps won't work.

## General / Open questions

- Awesome course, I really enjoyed it, well done!
- Keep in mind that people will start the course, interrupt for days, come back later. Sometimes, I had to go back because I didn't remember `rackup` command. I would add a "useful commands" section at the end of the course
- every chapter should have an introduction of what you're going to learn and a recap + next steps at the end, to help focus
- When updating the course with a new Ruby version, remember to change the links
- Whenever you write some code, there should be a test. What's the best way to test this app?
